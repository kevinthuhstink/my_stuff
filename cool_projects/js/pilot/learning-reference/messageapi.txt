RESTful API of client/server communication
    contains a method, url, headers, and an optional body
    the method tells the server what to do
    the url identifies where the request came from
    the headers specify metadata about the request
    the optional body gives data data to the server to handle the request

PORTS:
    ports are communication endpoints.
    ports within an ip address dictate how you access the information
    within the website.
        port 20: file transfer
        port 22: SSH
        port 80: HTTP
        port 443: HTTPS
    depending how you want to access the server information, you have to
    use its respective port
    ports 0-1024 are already delegated for other things, everything else
    is fair game
        port 3000: create-react-app default
        port 8000: gatsby
