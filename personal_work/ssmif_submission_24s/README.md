# Coding Journey

## I started in school...
The projects done in school are probably lost forever.  
After I finished high school, I decided to get a new computer,  
and sadly I forgot to port over many of the files in it.  
I've done quite a bit in high school:  
starting with Python, struggling with Java, understanding C...  
but nothing that I'm really proud of.
### Learned: Python, Java, C, C++

## I attempted some LeetCode...
I started with LeetCode, and some of my worst work can be seen in there.  
I did 75 problems, and realized doing only LeetCode won't get me anywhere,  
so I wanted to start trying other things as well.
### Learned: Data Structures

## I wanted to try Web Development...
After getting bored with LeetCode (and Java as a whole), I moved on to FrontEnd Web Development.
I never knew much HTML/CSS/JS beforehand, but building a single web page (albeit with a lot of functionality),  
has really taught me quite a bit.  

After my quick excursion with machine learning, I might delve into backend for a while.
### Learned: HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS)

## The "quick" excursion with machine learning...
I'm using the TensorFlow python library to construct machine learning models.  
Right now, I've only made one that's actually capable of anything,  
but from making that one I've gathered the coding knowledge and also the theoretical background  
necessary for creating and optimizing more complex neural networks in the future.
### Learned: TensorFlow, Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### Future Goals: Bootstrap 5, Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB, AWS.
### It would be nice to complete my first web dev tech stack.
