# TensorFlow Machine Learning
### Done in python

1-tensors.py: Intro to tensors, messing with tensor functions

2-car-prices.py: First rudimentary machine learning model to predict secondhand car prices

3-malaria-cnn.py: First attempt at constructing a convolutional neural network

4-malaria-optimization.py: Learning techniques that can be used to strengthen the neural network

5-malaria-MLops.py: Using TensorBoard to visualize data, and tuning the neural net even more
