# Learning React using:

## `npx create-react-app`

Followed a React course on scrimba, resulting in this cute web page.
Only React.js and plain CSS were used in this project.
No React Router was used either.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
