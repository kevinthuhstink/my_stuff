09-23-2023: Deep Blue Walk

The fact that you are miserable is because you tried so hard and failed,
but always remember the only thing we can do is try.
Trying and struggling is often the only thing we can do,
and often times it leads to an inevitable failure.

Feeling every emotion, not necessarily understanding them,
is important for being fulfilled in life, to take few regrets into the afterlife.
Joy makes me happy in the short term, but it comes with the cost of regretting
what could've been if we tackled the complexities of every other emotion.

From Your Lie in April, Kousei Arima told me,
"I keep going, practicing through all the pain, suffering, and hatred from everyone around me,
for those few moments when I touch everyone with my emotions, and exit stage with smiles on their faces."
Even if everyone around you seems like they're against you,
as long as you expressed yourself for that special someone to hear,
that is enough to validate who you've become.

What do you seek from love?
Why was your time so dissatisfactory?
