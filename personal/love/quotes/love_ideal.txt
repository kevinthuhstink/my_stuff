Rintaro Tsumugi: A "Model" Confession

. . . . . . I love you. 
I considered keeping things between us
Just the way they are.

Since to me, even the smallest thing,
Like seeing you smile,
Is more than enough.
And I didn't want to trouble you,
Considering our school don't get along.

. . . But at that time with the sparklers,
When I thought about the time we spent together ending,
I felt . . .
really, really lonely. 

And that's when I realized . . .
"Ah, this is what people who are going out feel . . . "
And before I realized it,
The words came out of my mouth . . .

I'm fully aware that what I'm telling you is super, super selfish. 
I'm surprised at myself for even doing this.
And I know that it's really, inconsiderate of me.
. . . . . .
But still, I don't want things to stay this way.
Because if "going out" means spending lots of time with someone special,
With someone who gives you strength and courage, 
Then I want it. 

I want to be with you more.
Will you go out with me?
